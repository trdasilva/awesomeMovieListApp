# Awesome Movie List App

For this project, I decided to use VIPER architecture pattern, I choose it over MVP or MVVM pattern because of VIPER focus on the clean architecture concepts.
Basically, we have two main modules, MovieList and MovieDetail, representing the main features of the app, each module contains the respective presenter, view, router e interactor if needed. 
On the main screen, I used the card concept to represent each movie on the list.
